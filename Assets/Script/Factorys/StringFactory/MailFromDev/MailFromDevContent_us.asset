      Data: "for accompanying <CatName> ' s life, <br> was in <CatByAdoptLocation>
        , because of your hand, <br> was able to feel the warmth of a cat for the
        first time . < br >< br > Secretly tell you~ On that day, there were < TotalCatCount
        > cats in the world of Cat Death. < br > This means that the probability
        of you meeting it is only 0.00001% . < br > Every fate is so precious , The
        same is true for the encounter between \"The Cat Died\" and you. < br ><
        br > Parting, in anyone's eyes, is a very difficult subject; < br > No matter
        at any stage of life, when we have to say \"goodbye\", < br > We always I
        can't stop the turmoil in my heart, and here I want to share with you a saying
        that the team likes very much: < br >< br ><b> \"After a journey is over,
        no matter what the result is, there is something to be gained in life.\"
        < /b>< br >< br > Therefore, most of the feedback we give players on the
        design of cats' birth, aging, sickness and death is \"a beautiful symbol
        you have obtained\", < br > For example: the potted plants in the greenhouse
        are saved by you, The life that can bloom because of you; < br > Dandelion
        diary is to record those precious moments with you. < br >< br > But this
        is not to hope that everyone will not feel sad, < br > We found that there
        is beauty and love in sadness, < br > Whether it is guilt or longing, it
        all comes from a past or longing Beautiful, < br > There will always be a
        moment in life when it is too late to say goodbye. The team making such a
        game is also to make up for the regrets in the heart. < br > Hope to present
        those precious meanings that are easy to ignore when falling into sadness
        For you\u2014\u2014 < br >< br > When players continue to accompany cats
        through their lives in \"Cats Die\" , the greenhouse will become more abundant;
        < br > When we continue to travel with these precious experiences , the things
        you love will always be with you, making life more colorful. < br >< br ><b>
        The departure of the cat does not mean the end, but the beginning of another
        story. </b>< br >< br > Every parting and sadness makes us know how to cherish
        every minute and every second that can still be with important things. <
        br > In the near future, we will add and improve various systems, and \"Memory
        Park\" will open many plots. < br > Not only referring to several animal
        protection issues The main plot of \"The Cat's Death\" also has real stories
        that happened around you and me. < br > If you have a special story with
        your cat, welcome to submit it to us. < br > In the future production process,
        you will have the opportunity to record it in the game ! < br >< br > Finally,
